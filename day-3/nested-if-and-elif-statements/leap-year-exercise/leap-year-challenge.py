# Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. 
# A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. 
# The reason why we have leap years is really fascinating, this video does it more justice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX96xng7sAE

year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))
 
if year % 4 == 0:
    if year % 100 == 0:
        if year % 400 == 0:
            print("Leap year.")
        else:
            print("Not leap year")
    else:
        print("Leap year.")
else:
    print("Not leap year.")

# if year is divisible by 400 then is_leap_year
# else if year is divisible by 100 then not_leap_year
# else if year is divisible by 4 then is_leap_year
# else not_leap_year
