#Fix the code below ðŸ‘‡

print(Day 1 - String Concatenation)
print("String Concatenation is done with "+" sign.")
    print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")

# Answer

# added quotes at beginning 
print("Day 1 - String Manipulation")
# changed outer double quote tp single quote
print('String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.')
# removed extra indentation
print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
# removed extra bracket
print("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
